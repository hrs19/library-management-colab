2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-colab.git```

4. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch `your-name/function-you-are-working-on` example: `john/init-book-class`.
   
    ```git checkout -b your-branch-name```

6. **Implement Your Task**: Work on your assigned task or choose an open issue to work on. Make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and guidelines.

7. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made changes, stage and commit them to your branch.
   
    ```git add .```
   
    ```git commit -m "Your commit message"```

9. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
    
    ```git push origin your-branch-name```

11. **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New pull request" button. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description for your pull request. 

12. **Review and Collaborate**: Collaborate with peers by reviewing their pull requests, providing feedback, and participating in discussions.

13. **Merge Pull Requests**: Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository by project maintainers.

14. **Stay Updated**: Keep your forked repository in sync with the main repository by regularly fetching updates from the main repository and merging them into your fork.
